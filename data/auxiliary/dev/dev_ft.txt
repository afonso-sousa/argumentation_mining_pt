Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone	Nowadays , everyone can see the effect of technology on their life , especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone . There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications , which are mentioned as follows .	First and foremost , email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology . Many years ago , peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters , and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes , and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered . But nowadays , all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free , and send their emails to everyone in no time , besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not .	Another important aspect on technology is transferring money . Today , students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before . Not only with the help of sending email , but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online . Therefore , with the advent of internet and online paying systems , you can do many thing at your home easily .	Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments . Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world . For example , one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries . In the past time doctors used pig heart ' s valve to implant , but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement . But now , biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily .	To sum up , technology has helped us to have more comfortable life . You can see its effects on transportation , communication , medicine and so forth .	Computer has negative effects to children	Nowadays , thanks to the development of technology , computer is now indispensable to life . Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently . In my opinion , the latter opinion is true .	First , using computer constantly has bad influence on children ' s eyes . When they concentrate on computer for too long , their eyes will get tired , which is the main reason for some eyes problems , typically shortsighted .	Moreover , children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills , they will know little about the outside life . It is a well - known fact that people who are addicted to games , especially online games , can eventually bear dangerous consequences . For instance , several teenagers play games without rest , which leads to health depression , a typical example is the death of Korean gamer , who had a non - stop playing for 3 days .	Finally , even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much . Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose , most of them are attracted by facebook , blog , etc . instead . Due to this neglect , they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet , they will have no time for their studying .	In conclusion , although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life , it still has its bad side , especially for children . People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose .	Sporting events easing international tensions , releasing patriotic feelings	For most folks on Earth , the need to gather in one place , and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation . This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation . This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols .	Firstly , during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event . For example , when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers . This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality . Thus , world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace .	Secondly , these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country . For instance , when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field . South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night . This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team . As a result , it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events .	In conclusion , after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries , it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society , but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness . This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future .	Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless	Unemployment is clearly a global problem , be it in developed countries or developing ones . However , I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens , rather than the government , to help them out .	Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only . Tax revenue is collected from those who works . Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers . Besides , there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure , such as health care service and education , so addressing unemployment should have low priority .	Also , it is obvious that , to survive in this competitive world , one has to work hard and equip themselves well . If they could get free financial help from the government , they might end up with out any motivation to work at all .	Of course , this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance . They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support . In this case , the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest - free bank loans for them , so that they can have the chance to get back to work . After all , it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again .	In conclusion , my point of view is that , although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people , direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity .	Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit ?	Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain . He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself . Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs , while others are concerned that animals should not be misused . This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication .	Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as , cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them . Likewise , other animals such as , horses , cattles and donkeys for farming , agriculture and as a mode of transportation . Many people keep pets like dogs and cats , trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples . They are kept for security purposes in houses .	On the other hand , many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits . For instance , cows are often injected by Oxytocin , a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation . This in turn , causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle . Furthermore , thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products . Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights . Many other practices like , equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster . And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals .	From my prospective , human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters . Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime .	Museums and art galleries will disappear soon ?	It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology ; therefore , some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon . Although modern technology make it possible , I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear .	On the one hand , technology indeed simplifies people ' s life all the time . Obviously , people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home , save the time and money on the road , which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society . However , in accordance with recent research , experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face - to - face communication .	On the other hand , the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture . First of all , authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos . It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos , so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it . Furthermore , museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages ; therefore , these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture .	In conclusion , I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions , but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture .	Keeping animals in zoos	Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized . Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn .	First , critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non - human persons and they should have the right of having freedom . This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures . That is because , many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require . The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment . In addition , sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe .	On the other hand , the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology . Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby - born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world . Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public . Also , zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life . This is due to the fact that , in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters . Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced .	In conclusion , both of the arguments have strong supports , but in my own view , more good come from zoos than bad . However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention .	Are museums necessary ?	I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary , even though we can see the art works and historical objects online .	Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience . We can browse the art work from all over the world at home . However , people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size . By contrast , the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling . For example , only when we see the real mummy , can we experience mystique .	In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits , museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing . For example , at American Museum of Natural History , you can make a bone - by - bone reproduction of the museum ' s stegosaurus ; at Museum of Art in New York , you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music . While if you " visit " the museum online , you may not able to get this kind of experience .	Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes . For instance , you can ' t see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist . What ' s more , not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen . Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough . These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects .	In conclusion , I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects .	Prohibit public smoking ?	The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors . As a result , some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area . It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run .	Firstly , it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time . Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking . A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases . Therefore , the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented .	Secondly , the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender . For instance , the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés , hospital and shopping street . This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result , Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness . This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole .	To sum up , the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation . It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country .	Whether athletes and singers are overpaid ?	Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries , which can be up to millions of dollars each year . However , that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society . I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social , economic fields .	First of all , some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own . For example , hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship . They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training , let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves . In addition , although there are many singers and athletes , few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately . Overcoming all these obstacles , they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts .	However , their talents should not be overrated . Other people say that singers and athletes , in fact , contribute insignificantly to the development of the society . It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms . While scientists invent machines serving daily lives , doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation , singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life . They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience . Indeed , their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists , albeit necessary . Hence , their privilege of salary seems groundless , while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities .	From all analysis suggested above , professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions . I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields , namely science and society , who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation .	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions .	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients .	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well - being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign .	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well - being .	Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school	I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom . Here are my reasons .	Studying at home by using technology is convenient . The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . You can study any time you want . However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home .	First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help .	Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance - learning program may not be for you .	Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities .	For the above reasons , I agree that distance education can ' t replace traditional school .	Farmland , housing and industry or saving land for animals ?	Nowadays , there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals . People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance . As far as I am concerned , I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important . The reasons are based on the following aspects .	First , land used for farmland , housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society . There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture , real estate industry and industry , in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy , because they produce plenty of profits . What is more , the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry . It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate . Thus the needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important .	Second , farmland , housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life . It is clearly understood that farming , housing and industry provide us the food we eat , place we live , clothes we wear , which are essential to live . Especially in some poor areas , survival is the most significant thing . In addition , highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life .	Last I want to mention is that even though farmland , housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals , it can do good to protect the endangered animals . According to the discuss above , agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy . With the economy development , we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals . For instant , we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct .	All in all , protecting endangered animals is necessary , nevertheless , human needs for farmland , housing and industry are more important .	Do zoos serve any useful function ?	It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals .	Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct .	On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons .	From my point of view , I agree with the first group . In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity .	University education restriction	Universtiy is an entrance to life . It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached .	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain .	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively .	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white - collar ones .	In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners .	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions .	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients .	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well - being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign .	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well - being .	Childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life	I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one ' s life . It ' s not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives , but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think .	Starting with our adulthood , we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives . We are told at what hour we shall wake up , how we shall dress up and how we shall behave . Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community . But during our childhood , though responsibilies exist , we are much more free to do what we would like to . Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren ' t supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult .	Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day . Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you . There are lots of new facts you can learn , stories you can listen to and things you can see . Therefore , childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most .	Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child . Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults , and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination . In adulthood , people are forced to express themselves in boundaries , therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination .	Childhood , in several aspects , is the happiest period of our lives . It ' s not only because of the nature of childhood and children , but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults . In an ideal world with less boundaries , social judgement and more freedom of thought , things could be different ; but since this is not the case , it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days .	Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life	Nowadays , the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before , parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them , just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods . Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that , for example , asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves . In my views , I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part - time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons .	First of all , when children get a job , they are able to earn money by themselves , instead of getting pocket money from their parents . Thus , it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money . Take me as an example , when I was 16 , I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own . At the beginning of the semester , I was told to buy a text book . Unfortunately , I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend . Therefore , I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money , and that did influence me in my life now .	Secondly , by taking a part - time job , they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done . For instance , if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work , the company may reduce his payment or even fire him . To compare with the school life , they might suffer only a small punishment at school . Under the circumstances , he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work .	In conclusion , to help their children to adapt adult life , parents should let them experience it as much as they can . Due to the reasons given above , to encourage children taking a part - time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life .	Successful people try new things and take risks	I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are . In my opinion , one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things . The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks .	There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things . For example , if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people , you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places . By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future . These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can ’ t be always found in books .	I do believe that great success requires taking great risks . If you want to gain very high profits in investments , you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money . If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam , you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies . The more you take risks , the greater your successes will be . If you don ’ t take any risks , you will have an ordinary life with average successes . That ’ s why it is important to take risks .	In sum , I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them .	Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people	Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first .	First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . Then , many people did not have money . When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . So that , government should invest to create more jobs . When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . Therefore , criminal rate were drop . Thus , people have a good quality life .	Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . These impact on every living creature in the world . So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . If we lived in good environment , our life would be better .	Lastly , family is a root of society . If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble .	In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people .	Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn ?	Everyone is different . Although students are in the same process of education system , learning abilities in each students are not equal . Some students are fast learner , but some students are not . Thus , paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate , and it is not fair for teacher . So that , I disagree with this notion .	To begin with , in schools , main task of teacher to give knowledge to students , and this role have to finish in time . there are certain period of time for teachers to teach . In these short time , it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class . Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule . If teachers pay attention to specific students , their work might not finish on time , and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know .	Second , learning abilities in each students is different . It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time . Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not . Therefore , testing result are different . This problems depend on how hard study they do . It is not teachers fault . Thus , teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get .	Lastly , there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get . That is problem in quality of education . Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics . Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary . This problem should not be happened . Therefore , grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher .	In conclusion , I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class . Besides , learning abilities of student are different . Moreover , there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get .	Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas ?	When we watch movies or dramas , some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished . While there are also some people who do not like this . Personally , I prefer to see good people get rewarded . However , if the good people always get an happy ending , I don ’ t think it ’ s proper .	First , if all the story end up in the same way , it will be boring . If good people always win , we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas . Then we will feel less interested in them . But if the good people are not always rewarded , we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story . For example , Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl . But now many people , including me , have been tired with it . I don ’ t want to see the same kind of ending again and again . So we can ’ t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs .	Even in the real world , good people can get a bad ending sometimes . And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies . So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded , they may think it will be true in the real world . They will be misleading by those movies . And they may act like good people in order to get reward . Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded , they may feel upset and not to be a good person . But in fact , the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not . So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding .	In fact , those good endings sometimes are helpful . Some people may be encouraged to do good things . But like I said , this kind of behavior won ’ t last long , because someday they will realize the truth . So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories . And if they can , they will be good people no matter how the story ends .	Based on my arguments above , I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing .	One important thing that I want to change about my hometown	Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place . However , it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements . In my hometown , there are almost complete public utilities for one ’ s needs but transportation . So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation . Since I ’ m facing the traffic congestion every day . And this problem seem to get worst .	At first , it should have more alternatives to use public transportation , such as a subway train or a sky train . Hence , people will have more ways to go to a place . Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community , It makes people in this area have no choice . They must take only a bus to go to another place . If a subway and a sky train are available here , it will be more convenience to them . For example , people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule . On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus . Also , this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly .	Secondly , the buses provide merely two routes in this community . It is absolutely a major problem . For example , if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses , I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus . Obviously , it is waste of time . They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily .	Lastly , having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars . Also , it provides many advantages . For instance , people can save their expenses form gasoline , which nowadays is getting more expensive . The necessary energy will slowly be used up , since people use less their own cars .	To sum up , the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people ’ s living . I wish one day this problem would be changed . And then , the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community .	Classroom learnng vs online education	There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion . As far as I am concerned , I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning . I list my reasons as follows .	First , indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes . In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates , because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better , it will force you for making your performance more better . For example , When I was in First Year in B Com , I was not serious in my study , but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me , it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects . Finally I got 1st rank in final exam .	Second , in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time . It makes you perfect in time management skills . Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others . It makes you communication and of course your group skills better , which can help you in your future and career .	Third , professors play vital role in classroom learning , most of them are specialists is their subjects , and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills . You can improve your skills by work under any professor ; you can ask questions face to face , it will clear your doubts . In result you learn quickly . For example , I have my personal experience . For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses , but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT , and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster .	It ' s undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary , but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning .	From the discussed above , we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons .	Dormitory or apartment ?	When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school , most students always get confused between these two options : living in an apartment , or in university dormitories . As far as I am concerned , both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages .	On the one hand , living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university . For instance , students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club , or joining sports club . Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates . In addition , it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers . I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students .	On the other hand , living off campus prepares students for the real life . For example , students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible , independent , punctual , co - operative compared to living in university dormitories . They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time , and dealing with the utility bills . In addition , students also have to focus on their study , and try to maintain their grades higher . Furthermore , students also have a chance to know about the community around them . Interacting with the people , and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation .	From given the evidences , it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits . If I have to choose , I would definitely choose the second option : living in an apartment . I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life .	People benefit more from coming computers into their lives	Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century . However , some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them , but computers have brought many advantages to our lives . From my point of view , computers have an important and inevitable role in economic , business , and other part of societies . In addition , they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties .	Admittedly , by using computers in many industries human ' s role has been reduced . Nowadays , computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries , which were early done by human . Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks , which were carried out by human early . For example , many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots , which are controlled by computers . In addition , car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers . Despite many advantages , by coming computers many jobs has been vanished . A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers .	Computers have an important role in social and personal life . Computers have opened up a network connection among people . This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message . Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers . Moreover , People can use computers to extract their essential information easily . By contrast , excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties . The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors . People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees .	By considering all reasons , advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages . People benefit more from coming computers into their lives . In addition , computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier .	The biggest risk is not taking any risk	" The biggest risk is not taking any risk ." The ones who have a big dream , they need to be brave and dare to live new situations . It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks , but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong . Therefore , it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out .	Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences . In fact , life may not be easy ; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks , but in the end , it can be surprisingly wonderful . For instance , some people abandon their job , family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them . In the beginning , it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity , but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired ; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country .	In fact , many people are afraid to take risks and fail . It is possible to get frustrate along the way , but it is vital to never give up on your dream . To illustrate , Walt Disney , whose career is famous , had a challenging life . One of the difficulties was some of his histories , such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs , were turned down . He heard lots of " no ", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination , after all what he had gone through , he never stop chasing his dreams .	To conclude , in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations . Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to , it is necessary to have courage to take risks , be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life .	Mobile phone ; " Iron man " / " Weichat " - destroy social interactions ?	Recently , there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication . Indeed , mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages , bringing convenience and entertainment into our life . However , as far as I am concerned , I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems .	In the first place , spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life . In the first place , as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones , they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities . Moreover , continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children .	Furthermore , there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as " Iron man " . In those games , children are rewarded for being more violent , and this violence is repeated again and again . For instance , many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot , which many lead to increased aggressive feelings , thoughts and behaviours . Therefore , the hardship of communication may be developed .	However , other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint . With rapid development of the internet , people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet . For instance , as lots of chatting apps available online such as " Weichat ", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication . Therefore , mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication .	After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above , we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication , they also contribute to some social problems .	A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money	It ' s such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money , especially in nowadays society . Each individual visualize success differently . Still , my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income .	Money is undeniably pivotal , but ways of earning it is also various . A person ' s great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself . Nevertheless , a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard - working , dedication and passion . Whether it is a personal or a social achievement , that man is laudable .	More importantly , the more beneficial for the society his achievement is , the more successful he is considered . For instance , Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention ' s productivity is countless useful for mankind . On the other hand , the fact of knowing a man ' s utilization of his money remains in the dark . Therefore , judging a person by his income is difficult , especially in the success aspect .	In conclusion , using only money as a scale to measure a man ' s success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs . Yet , it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements , which can only accomplished by passion , dedication and ethics , are helpful not only for himself .	Factor of choosing a career .	In many societies , choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered . Nevertheless , while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor , I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard .	To begin with , I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well . However , aspects such as : friendly colleagues , environment and work - place condition , sometimes , have even more impact on person ' s happiness and quality of life . People , for instance , who don ' t like their co - workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs , despite of a high salary . In this sense , it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position .	Further and even more importantly , most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements , skills and the position they reach . In other words , career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are , likely , more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary . For example , people , who work in monotonous jobs , where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied , even though they have a very good salaries .	In conclusion , I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators , as there are other even more important aspects such as : friendly co - workers , working conditions and professional achievements .	Old and young workers	Throughout human history , the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor . This is still true in the industrial society nowadays , where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over - 50 workers . There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace .	First and foremost , old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm . The old were raised in poverty , probably caused by war , look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view . The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change , or more precisely , to accept the existence of such modernity . For example , most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human ' s capability .	Secondly , their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life . In other words , that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology . This , by all means , is outweigh by youngsters ' adventurousness and bravery . Blatantly seen , success of most companies stems from young people , whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment .	Last but not least , knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly . Who would the employer choose , an old man with old - fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject , but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages . Not to undermine old workers , but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace .	All in a nutshell , workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects . However , in my point of view , it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company .	The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life ?	There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles . It is argued that these so - called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions , and there is no need to maintain them . However , from my point of view , what can be expected , is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society .	It is undeniable that the country ' s culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life . For instance , in Vietnam , many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities , are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts . This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor ' s early life through books and images , which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed .	In tradition , a person should look back at the past , mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle , to progress . Understanding why , and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today . Also , study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing .	To sumarize , there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life . They are the ones that teach , and will teach us to be self - esteem and experienced , which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention .	University education restriction	Universtiy is an entrance to life . It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed . It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people . Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached .	To begin with , outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage . To be precise , such abstract or complicated informatin , easily absorbed by those students , may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills . Besides , it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done . University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain .	However , university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills . Therefore , it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people , who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively .	What is more , there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people . Apart from the disheartened ones , many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs , mostly the white - collar ones .	In conclusion , university restriction has both pros and cons . In my opinion , it will yield more negative results than positive ones . That ' s why it should be made available for a wide range of learners .	Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence	The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today ' s society are very concerned for . Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society . I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs .	First of all , we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself . As a result , criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs . Thus , citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally . Moreover , while on duty , not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars , houses , streets are likely to be destroyed by guns . Therefore , a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one .	Secondly , police force carries guns only in high crime societies . Hence , people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime ' s categories such as theft , robbery , murder , rape , vandalism , arson . Obviously , Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence .	In conclusion , from the above views , although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary , it will bring the higher level of violence . Additionally , the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians ' lives .	Gun control and increasing violence	Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control .	First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . However , this is not as simple as it sounds .	In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control .	Moreover , there will be law non - abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes .	All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control .	A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues	In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions .	The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients .	The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well - being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign .	In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well - being .
